g.raphael
=========

Charts for RaphaÃ«l AMD Dojo Modules (Customized for Encuestame)

Fork of https://github.com/encuestame/g.raphael

Changed the path to Raphael in g.raphael.js's define method from a relative path to 'raphael', making it more flexible - simply define the path to raphael in require.config.paths, and you're all set.
